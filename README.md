## LeetCode Solutions Repository 🚀

Welcome to my **LeetCode Solutions Repository**! Here, I have documented my journey of solving algorithmic problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), aiming to improve my problem-solving skills and knowledge of data structures and algorithms.

### Check my [Leet Code Profile](https://leetcode.com/u/s01tan/)! 👀

### File Naming Convention:
- Problems are named with their **LeetCode problem number** and a brief description.
  - Example: `1-two-sum.py` (solution for "Two Sum")

## 🌟 Key Highlights
- **Languages Used**: Primarily written in Java, JavaScript and Python.
- **Well-Commented**: Each solution includes a clear explanation of the approach and time/space complexity analysis.
- **Iterative Improvements**: Includes optimized versions of some solutions.

## 🔧 Tools and Technologies
- **Git** for version control
- **LeetCode** platform for problem-solving
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) as my primary code editor

## 🏆 Goals of the Repository
- To track my progress and learning.
- To share and discuss solutions with the programming community.
- To provide a reference for others preparing for coding interviews.
